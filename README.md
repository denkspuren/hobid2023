# HoBid 2023: Podcasting-Workshop

Here are the slides that I used for the two podcasting workshops that I gave at HoBid 2023.

Hobid 2023 is the international summer school _Approaches to Research on Teaching and Learning in Higher Education_, now in its 3rd year, this year from September 11-15, 2023 in Paderborn, Germany.

I created the Markdown file `PodcastWorkshop.qmd` in Visual Studio Code and translated it into a [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) presentation using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (version 1.3.450). The Quarto documentation can be found [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/). The result (i.e. the slides) can be viewed at

The two hours scheduled for each workshop proved to be too short. I was barely able to get past the second exercise in that time. I guess the workshop would take more like 3-4 hours.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to create a usable PDF from the slides, because the Unicode characters are missing.
